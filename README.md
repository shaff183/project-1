We gathered annual reports from the EPA detailing AQI (Air Quality Index) readings across the United States along the six major pollutants.  We then analyzed this data from 2015-2019 in comparison with 2020 to see if during this year of covid-19, quaratining, and working from home, there was an improvement in air quality and reduction in pollution.
